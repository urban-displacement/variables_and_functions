# The UDP Repository Template 

Use this repository as a template for all other UDP repositories. 

## Protocol

* Use Github for project management, code, and outward facing documentation (e.g. html maps, instructions, results, etc.). Folder structure should be: 
	* code - all code in python or R
	* docs - results, documentation, writings, etc.
	* data - small data files for public use (each file has to be under 100mb)
	* maps - html map files
	* .asset - images and other repo specific content

* Use Google Drive for large data storage, meeting notes, and pre-release shared documents. 

## Starting a new UDP repo

Click on the "[Use this template](https://github.com/urban-displacement/template_repo/generate)" button above to create a new repo based on this file structure. Make sure to edit the readme's as necessary. 

## Project Management

Github provides a great format to create tasks using [*issues*](https://github.com/urban-displacement/UDP_repo_template/issues) and organizing those issues using a [*projects*](https://github.com/urban-displacement/UDP_repo_template/projects) board. 

### Issues
Like a scientific notebook, issues allow you to define a task and maintain a conversation within that task until completion. It's important to use this protocol so that your project manager and team members can keep track of progress and see what needs to be done. 

* When you start a new issue, give it: 
	* A title
	* A description of the task
	* assign it to a team member
	* provide a label

You can tag teammembers (e.g. @timthomas) in the description to call their attention to the task. Keep note of the progress of the issue as it matures. 

### Projects 
Projects allow you to view all your issues on a [Kanban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development)) board to see what needs to be done, what's in progress, and what's finished.
